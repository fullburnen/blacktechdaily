## Access Locally
<code>
$ git clone https://github.com/teamwarren/blacktechdaily.git

$ yarn or npm install

$ yarn start or npm start

To see the newsFeed, you'll need to create a (NewsAPI api key)[https://newsapi.org/account]. Once you have your
api key, do the following:
1. Create a env.js file in the root of this project.
2. Create and export a constant of your api key i.e. `export const apiKey = 'apiKey=1234567890123456789012345678901a';` 

env.js is included in the gitignore files, so this prevents you from pushing your api key.
